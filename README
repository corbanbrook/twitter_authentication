This is a "Sign in with Twitter"-oauth authorization generator for rails, based
closely on the restful_authentication plugin by Rick Olson which can be found at
http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master.

"Sign in with Twitter" is the pattern of authentication that allows users to
connect their Twitter account with third-party services in as little as one
click.


Step 1 - Installation:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/corbanbrook/twitter_authentication.git


Step 2 - Generate Authentication System:

  ./script/generate twitter_authenticated user sessions

  The first parameter specifies the model that bootstraps the twitter account
  (typically a user or account model).

  The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is the
  controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the site.


Step 3 - Migrate User Account Model

  View the created migration and see if it meets your need. This model bootstaps
  itself onto the users twitter account and caches all user details. Any additional
  fields you require to store should be added to the migration at this time.

  ./rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development|production

Step 4 - Register Application with Twitter:

  Visit http://twitter.com/oauth_clients/ and register a new application.

  Point the Callback url to: http://your.application.url/sessions/callback

  Upon completion you will receive a consumer key and secret you will need to
  add to config/twitter_oauth.yml

Step 5 - Add Authentication to your Controllers

  First 'include TwitterAuthenticatedSystem' in your ApplicationController.

  Then, to add authentication to protect your controllers use a before_filter

  ie.

    before_filter :login_required


* Now your application should be ready to go? *


Requirements:

* Twitter gem by John NuneMaker http://twitter.rubyforge.org/
  an API wrapper for Twitter and Twitter Search API's

  gem install twitter



API

* login_required

  Use on controllers to autheticate access to individual pages.

  ie.

  class UsersController < ApplicationController
    before_filter :login_required, :except => 'index'
    ..
  end

* authorized?, logged_in?

  Show the logged in state of the user.
