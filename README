This is a "Sign in with Twitter"-oauth authorization generator for rails, based
closely on the restful_authentication plugin by Rick Olson which can be found at
http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master.

"Sign in with Twitter" is the pattern of authentication that allows users to
connect their Twitter account with third-party services in as little as one
click.


Step 1 - Installation:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/corbanbrook/twitter_authentication.git


Step 2 - Generate Authentication System:

  ./script/generate twitter_authenticated user sessions

  The first parameter specifies the model that bootstraps the twitter account
  (typically a user or account model).

  The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is the
  controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the site.


Step 3 - Register Application with Twitter:

  Visit http://twitter.com/oauth_clients/ and register a new application.

  Point the Callback url to: http://your.application.url/sessions/callback

  Upon completion you will receive a consumer key and secret you will need to
  add to config/twitter_oauth.yml


Requirements:

* Twitter gem by John NuneMaker    http://twitter.rubyforge.org/
  an API wrapper for Twitter and Twitter Search API's

  gem install twitter
