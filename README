                            Twitter Authentication

This is a "Sign in with Twitter"-oauth authorization generator for rails, based
closely on the restful_authentication plugin.

"Sign in with Twitter" is the pattern of authentication that allows users to
connect their Twitter account with third-party services in as little is one
click.


Usage:

  ./script/generate twitter_authenticated user sessions

The first parameter specifies the model that bootstraps the twitter account
(typically a user or account model).

The second parameter specifies the sessions controller name.  This is
the controller that handles the actual login/logout function on the
site.


Requirements:

* Twitter gem by John NuneMaker    http://twitter.rubyforge.org/
  an API wrapper for Twitter and Twitter Search API's

  gem install twitter
